## What Is This File?

**Personal DNA** is your leadership identity file. It captures who you are as a leader — your goals, fears, success metrics, and behavioral patterns. The AI uses this to:
- Detect when you're in **Pressure Mode** (about to repeat old patterns)
- Personalize recommendations in commands like `prep_121` and `init_day`
- Understand your constraints and aspirations
- Provide context for decision-making

**Update frequency:** Quarterly + after major wins/failures  
**Used by:** `prep_121`, `init_day`, `shutdown_day`, `stakeholder_request`, `escalate`, Pressure Mode detection  
**Critical sections:** Constraints & Fears (powers Pressure Mode detection), Goals (guides 90-day focus)
