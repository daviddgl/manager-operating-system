## What Is This File?

**Company Strategy** captures the current North Star — your company's #1 goal and any secondary OKRs for this quarter. It's the "source of truth" for organizational priorities.

Commands use this to:
- Check alignment in `stakeholder_request` (Gate 2: Does this request align with company goal?)
- Prioritize in `init_week` and `prep_planning`
- Evaluate risks in `capacity_check`

**Update frequency:** Quarterly (with new company goals) or ad-hoc if strategy pivots  
**Used by:** `init_week`, `prep_planning`, `capacity_check`, `stakeholder_request`, `escalate`, `retro`  
**Most important:** §1 North Star — the one metric/goal everything else aligns to

---

**Theme:** [One-line theme for the quarter — e.g., "Make Customers Happier" or "Scale or Die"]

## 1. The North Star (Target State)

* **Objective:** [What the company is trying to achieve this quarter]
* **Key Metric:** [The metric that defines success — e.g., "Increase NPS from X → Y" or "Revenue from $A → $B"]

<!-- Add additional OKRs or strategic priorities if your company uses them. Keep it to the top 1-3. -->

## 2. Team-Specific Translations

> *Each team translates this strategy into their own context. See the relevant Team OS file → "Strategic Translation" section.*
