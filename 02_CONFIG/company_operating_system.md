## What Is This File?

**Company Operating System** documents your company's mission, vision, and core values. It's inherited context — the constraints and culture you operate within. You read it to align team decisions with company identity.

This is reference material; commands don't execute it directly, but it provides context for understanding company strategy and translating values to your team.

**Update frequency:** Per company (when you change companies, replace entirely)  
**Used by:** Strategic context for all commands; directly read in `prep_planning`, `retro`  
**Why it matters:** Grounds your decisions in company mission
