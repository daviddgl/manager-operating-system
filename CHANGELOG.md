# Changelog

All notable changes to the Manager Operating System (MOS) framework will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), adapted for AI-executable version upgrades.

## How to Upgrade

When a new version is released:

1. Download the new MOS template files
2. Run the `version_upgrade` command in your AI copilot
3. The AI will read your current version, compare to the CHANGELOG, and walk you through the changes

The upgrade preserves all your existing data and only asks about new/changed sections.

## [Unreleased]

> Changes documented here will be included in the next version.

### Added
- `templates/` folder as profession-specific setup entry point (extensible to `templates/coach/`, `templates/sales_leader/`, etc.)
- `templates/manager/SETUP_WIZARD.md` — moved from root; now lives at profession path
- `templates/manager/mos_template.md` — blank template bundle (tracked in git); generated by `scripts/bundle.sh` for use in 2-file setup flow
- `templates/README.md` — documents the templates folder convention and how to add new professions
- `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` — drift detection hook; blocks commits where source template files change without regenerating `mos_template.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — new "Development Setup" section with hook installation instructions

### Changed
- **Setup flow simplified to 2 files:** Users now paste `SETUP_WIZARD.md` + upload `mos_template.md` (instead of uploading all ~12 individual files). The AI fills the template and outputs one complete `mos_compiled.md`.
- `SETUP_WIZARD.md` (now at `templates/manager/SETUP_WIZARD.md`): updated intro, system rules, Phase 6C/6D, and Completion block to reflect 2-file flow and bundle output
- `scripts/bundle.sh`: now outputs two files — `bundle/mos_compiled.md` (local dev, git-ignored) and `templates/manager/mos_template.md` (tracked in git)
- `00_BOOT/README.md`: updated SETUP_WIZARD reference, "Bundled Upload" section renamed to primary deployment, platform table simplified to bundle-first
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: section 9 rewritten from "Individual or Bundled" to "Bundle-First"; updated setup next-step link
- `README.md`: Start Here and Quick Start updated to reflect 2-file setup; file structure diagram updated with `templates/` entry
- `.gitignore`: `SETUP_WIZARD.md` removed from root allowlist (moved to templates/); `templates/` and `templates/**` added to allowlist
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: updated references to SETUP_WIZARD location and setup flow

### Removed
- `SETUP_WIZARD.md` from repository root (moved to `templates/manager/SETUP_WIZARD.md`)

### Migration Steps

**For existing users upgrading to this version:**

1. **No action required for your OS.** Your `mos_compiled.md` and its contents are unchanged — this release only affects the setup flow and repo structure, not the OS layer format or commands.

2. **If you bookmarked `SETUP_WIZARD.md` at root:** Update your link to `templates/manager/SETUP_WIZARD.md`.

3. **If you contribute to this repo:** Install the pre-commit hook to prevent template drift:
   ```bash
   cp scripts/hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

4. **If you previously uploaded individual files** to your AI platform: You can continue using individual files — no functionality has changed. To switch to the bundle-first model, run `scripts/bundle.sh`, upload the resulting `bundle/mos_compiled.md`, and update Custom Instructions to use `00_BOOT/bootstrap_prompt.md`.
