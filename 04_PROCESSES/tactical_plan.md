## What Is This File?

**Tactical Plan** is your current roadmap — the 2–4 big goals for this quarter, key tasks/milestones, and risks. It translates company strategy into team-level execution.

Commands use this to:
- Prioritize work in `init_week` and `init_day`
- Check what's complete in `shutdown_week`
- Identify capacity available in `capacity_check`
- Evaluate new requests in `stakeholder_request` (is it on the plan or new?)
- Facilitate retros in `retro`

**Update frequency:** Quarterly (new plan each Q) + mid-quarter if strategy pivots  
**Used by:** `init_week`, `init_day`, `shutdown_day`, `shutdown_week`, `prep_planning`, `capacity_check`, `retro`, `stakeholder_request`  
**Critical sections:** §1 (Roadmap — what are the 2–4 goals?), §2 (Risks — what could derail us?)

**Theme:** [One-line theme — e.g., "Stability & Scalability" or "Growth Sprint"]
**Goal:** [Main objective for the quarter]
**Date:** [Quarter and Year — e.g., Q1 2026 (Jan - Mar)]
