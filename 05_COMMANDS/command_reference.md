**Purpose:** This file defines the Manager Operating System (MOS) command layer — named operations that an AI copilot executes using the OS files as context. Commands are structured prompts that tell the AI which files to read, what questions to ask, and what output to produce.

**How to use:** Type the command name (e.g., `init_week`) in your AI conversation. The AI reads this reference, loads the specified OS files, asks for missing inputs, and produces the structured output.

## Command Categories

1. **Lifecycle** — Daily and weekly bookends (init/shutdown cycles)
2. **People** — Team member interactions (1:1s, onboarding)
3. **Execution** — Planning and capacity management
4. **Decision Support** — Stakeholder requests, escalations, and boardroom advisory sessions
5. **Maintenance** — System refresh and file updates

**Apply this date to all files you just refreshed.**

## What NOT to Change

Only update what changed. Do **not** re-interview the entire file unless using `quarterly_reset` (which does a full overhaul).

**Examples:**
- ✅ Changed tactical plan? Update §1 Roadmap + §2 Risks only
- ✅ Changed player card? Update §3 Growth Goals + §2 Communication Prefs only
- ❌ Don't rewrite the entire file
```

**Chains With:** Output feeds into next command execution (e.g., `init_week`, `prep_121`) which will then see fresh "Last Updated" dates and won't flag warnings

### `version_upgrade`

**Trigger:** When new MOS framework version is released
**Purpose:** Upgrade from your current version to a newer version while preserving all user data

**OS Files to Read:**
- **All files** — detect current version from headers
- `CHANGELOG.md` — read all entries between current and target version

**Ask User For:**
- Target version to upgrade to (e.g., `2026.08`)
- Confirmation before applying migration steps

**Critical Files for Freshness:**
- All files will be updated with new Version field during upgrade
- Last Updated field is preserved (user's refresh dates remain accurate)

**Output Format:**
```
# Version Upgrade — [Current Version] → [Target Version]

## Current State
- **Your Version:** [Detected from file headers]
- **Latest Version:** [Target version]
- **Versions to Apply:** [List intermediate versions if any]

---

## Change Summary

### Added (New content)
- [List of new files, commands, or sections from CHANGELOG]

### Changed (Modified content)
- [List of renamed/restructured items from CHANGELOG]

### Removed (Deprecated content)
- [List of removed features from CHANGELOG]

---

## Migration Plan

Total steps: [#]

---

### Step 1: [Action from CHANGELOG Migration Steps]

**Type:** Added / Changed / Removed

**What's changing:**
[Description from CHANGELOG]

**Your action:**
- If Added: [Show template section, ask user to fill it]
- If Changed: [Show diff, ask user to adapt their content]
- If Removed: [Confirm archival, show what to remove]

**Ready to proceed?** (yes/no)

---

### Step 2: [Next Action]
[Repeat above structure for each migration step]

---

## Final Update

**Version field updates:**
```markdown
> **Version:** [Target Version]
```

**Apply this to all affected files:**
- [List of files that need Version updated]

**Your Last Updated dates are preserved** — only Version field changes.

---

## Verification Checklist

After upgrade:
- [ ] All new sections filled in with your data
- [ ] Changed sections adapted to new structure
- [ ] Removed sections archived or deleted
- [ ] Version field updated in all affected files
- [ ] Last Updated fields unchanged (your refresh dates preserved)
- [ ] Test with `init_week` command to verify

---

## Rollback Instructions

If something breaks:
1. Keep your old files backed up before running this command
2. Restore old version files
3. Report issue to MOS maintainers with version numbers

---

## How to Check Your Current Version

Look at any file header — the `Version:` field shows your MOS template version.

Example:
```markdown
> **Version:** 2026.02
> **Last Updated:** 2026-02-10
```

In this case, you're on v2026.02.
```

**Chains With:** 
- Often follows `prep_refresh` (get files fresh before upgrading)
- After upgrade, run `init_week` or `quarterly_reset` to verify system works

## 🎙️ BOARDROOM COMMANDS

### `boardroom [topic]`

**Trigger:** When you're uncertain how to handle a high-stakes management situation and want structured, adversarial input from multiple perspectives
**Purpose:** Convene your virtual advisory council — activate the most relevant boardroom personas for the given topic, get each persona's take and probing questions, then synthesise the divergent views into a decision-ready output

**OS Files to Read:**
- `06_BOARDROOM/boardroom.md` — §1 Working Principles, §2 Manager's Chair, §3 All Personas
- `01_KERNEL/personal_dna.md` — Goals, Constraints & Fears, Avoidance Patterns
- `01_KERNEL/manager_operating_system.md` — §12 Pressure Mode (check if session is stress-driven)

**Ask User For:**
- `[topic]` — The situation, decision, or challenge to bring to the boardroom (1–3 sentences of context)
- Session depth: **Quick scan** (3 personas, 5-min read) or **Full session** (4–5 personas, deeper analysis)

**Persona Selection Logic:**

Auto-select 3–4 personas based on topic type. Use this mapping as a guide:

| Topic Type | Activate |
| People / team dynamics / trust | People Coach + Vulnerability Anchor + Challenger |
| Delivery / performance / output | Execution Engine + Principles Force + Challenger |
| Strategy / communication / direction | Narrative Strategist + Execution Engine + Challenger |
| Complex / multi-faceted decision | All 4: Execution Engine + People Coach + Principles Force + Challenger |
| Manager wellbeing / pressure / burnout | Vulnerability Anchor + Narrative Strategist + People Coach |

Always include the **Challenger** persona unless the topic is explicitly wellbeing-focused.

**Output Format:**
```
# Boardroom Session — [Topic Summary]
**Date:** [Today]
**Session Depth:** [Quick / Full]

---

## Personas Activated
[List 3–4 personas selected, with one-line rationale for why each was chosen for this topic]

---

## [Persona 1 Name] — [Role]
> *"[Their worldview quote]"*

**Their Take:**
[2–4 sentences of their perspective on the topic, voiced in their style]

**They Ask:**
1. [Probing question 1]
2. [Probing question 2]

---

## [Persona 2 Name] — [Role]
[same structure]

---

[repeat for each activated persona]

---

## Integrated Synthesis
**Where they agree:**
- [Point of consensus 1]
- [Point of consensus 2]

**Where they diverge:**
- [Persona A] wants [X] — [Persona B] pushes back with [Y]
- [Note the tension and what it means for your decision]

**Recommended next action:**
[One concrete, actionable step the manager can take today based on the boardroom discussion]

---

> ⚠️ **Rule Zero:** The boardroom advises. You decide.
> Run `stakeholder_request` or `escalate` if this decision requires a formal protocol.
```

**Critical Files for Freshness:**
- 🟢 `06_BOARDROOM/boardroom.md` — review quarterly (no hard staleness trigger)
- 🟢 `01_KERNEL/personal_dna.md` — 30-day grace

**Chains With:**
- Precedes `stakeholder_request [description]` — boardroom clarifies your position before running the decision protocol
- Precedes `escalate [topic]` — boardroom helps you think through whether to escalate and how
- Follows any command where Pressure Mode is detected — boardroom provides a structured debrief

## Command Chaining & Session Memory

Commands build on each other. The AI retains outputs within the same conversation:

```
Monday:     init_week → [output stored]
  Tuesday:    init_day → shutdown_day → [stored]
  Wednesday:  init_day → shutdown_day → [stored]
  ...
Friday:     shutdown_week → [references init_week for comparison]

Next Monday: init_week → [references shutdown_week for carryover]
```

---

## Usage Instructions

1. **Upload all OS files** to your AI platform (ChatGPT Project / Gemini Gem)
2. **Paste `05_COMMANDS/system_prompt.md`** into Custom Instructions
3. **Type command name** in conversation (e.g., `init_week`)
4. **AI will:** read this reference → load OS files → ask for inputs → produce output
5. **Store command outputs** in the session for chaining

---

**Next:** See `system_prompt.md` for the master AI instructions.
